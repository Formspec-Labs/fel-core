# Mutation survivor follow-ups

**Origin:** Phase 2 of [`2026-05-23-test-suite-triage.md`](./2026-05-23-test-suite-triage.md).
**Baseline sha:** `7d0fd86` (full `make mutants-p0` run, 1060 mutants, 1h 7m wall-clock).
**Updated:** swarm-review remediation landed at sha `1eee8b4`; subsequent re-baseline may shift these numbers.

Per the plan's H2 classification policy, every surviving mutant gets one of:

- **`kill`** — write a test (referencing the spec section that motivates the behavior).
- **`equivalent`** — annotate in `.cargo/mutants.toml` `skip_calls` (or document inline) with a one-line justification.
- **`accept`** — low-value mutation in non-load-bearing code (rare; default is `kill` or `equivalent`).

Phase 2 closes when every row below is either killed (with test commit sha) or moved to the skip list. The baseline `conformance/mutation-baseline.jsonl` is the audit trend artifact; this doc is the actionable worklist.

## Per-file kill-rate snapshot (sha `7d0fd86`)

| File | Killed | Missed | Timeout | Unviable | Kill rate | Floor | Status |

| `prepare_host.rs` | 133 | 39 | 20 | 3 | 69% | — | **lowest; 59 to triage — Phase 3 proptest gap** |
| `dependencies.rs` | 13 | 10 | 0 | 1 | 56% | ≥80% | **24pp low; 10 to triage — Phase 3 proptest gap** |

**Totals**: 152 missed + 34 timeouts = **186 survivors across 9 files** (3 files at 100%).

## Triage taxonomy

Most survivors fall into one of five shapes. Each shape has a default classification:

| Shape | Example | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Boundary** (`>`↔`==`↔`>=`) | `replace > with ==` in budget check | **kill** — single boundary test usually covers all variants |
| **Match-arm deletion** | `delete match arm Expr::PostfixAccess` | **kill** — the arm exists for a reason; if no test exercises it, that's a coverage gap |
| **Return-value default** | `replace fn -> X with Default::default()` | **kill** when the return value is observable; **equivalent** when it's a Display impl or already-unit-shaped |
| **Arithmetic substitution** | `replace - with +`, `replace += with -=` | **kill** when the operation is load-bearing; usually points at index/offset math |
| **Match-guard collapse** | `replace match guard ... with true/false` | **kill** if the guard discriminates real paths; often equivalent if guard is defensive |

A small minority are genuine **equivalent** mutants:
- Identity-arithmetic replacements (`x + 0 ↔ x`)
- Defensive guards in unreachable code paths
- Diagnostic-message text changes (when the test doesn't assert the exact text)

## Per-file triage

### `evaluator/budget.rs` — CLOSED ✓

100% kill rate after sha `59be9d3` (boundary tests). No open items.

### `evaluator/builtins/money.rs` — CLOSED ✓

100% kill rate. The Cluster A/A′ tables and money_equality test cover the surface.

### `extensions/catalog.rs` — CLOSED ✓

100% kill rate (2 viable mutants both killed by `builtin_catalog_consistency.rs`).

### `evaluator/builtins/dates.rs` — 6 missed → triage

```
src/evaluator/builtins/dates.rs:52:13: delete match arm Value::Null in Evaluator<'a>::fn_time_part
src/evaluator/builtins/dates.rs:116:33: replace || with && in Evaluator<'a>::fn_duration
src/evaluator/builtins/dates.rs:133:13: delete match arm Value::Null in Evaluator<'a>::fn_duration
src/evaluator/builtins/dates.rs:215:9: replace Evaluator<'a>::coerce_string_to_date -> Option<Date> with None
... (2 more enumerated in mutants.out/missed.txt at sha 7d0fd86)
```

Mostly **kill** — null-propagation paths in `fn_time_part` and `fn_duration` aren't exercised; `coerce_string_to_date -> None` survives because we don't test the success path of string→date coercion with assertions strong enough to fail when it returns None. Add tests in `evaluator_tests.rs §Date functions`.

### `lexer.rs` — 12 missed + 13 timeout → triage

```
src/lexer.rs:211:26: replace += with *= in Lexer<'a>::skip_whitespace_and_comments
src/lexer.rs:319:40: replace - with + in Lexer<'a>::next_token
src/lexer.rs:325:40: replace - with + in Lexer<'a>::next_token
src/lexer.rs:333:36: replace - with / in Lexer<'a>::next_token
src/lexer.rs:375:42: replace match guard self.peek_at(1).is_some_and(|c| c.is_ascii_digit()) with true in Lexer<'a>::read_date_literal
src/lexer.rs:395:24: replace == with != in Lexer<'a>::read_number
src/lexer.rs:448:44: replace - with + in Lexer<'a>::read_string
... (5 more + 13 timeouts)
```

Mix of **kill** (arithmetic-on-index mutations need tests with multi-char source positions to discriminate) and likely **timeout-equivalent** (mutations that produce infinite tokenization loops; 30s timeout indicates the mutant doesn't terminate, which is itself a behavioral change — could be classified as killed-by-timeout). The 13 timeouts collectively suggest cluster-F-style consolidation of the lexer test suite would shake out real coverage gaps but is out of Phase 2 scope.

### `evaluator/core.rs` — 42 missed → triage (BELOW 85% FLOOR)

The largest survivor block. 42 across 215 caught. Most likely buckets:
- Diagnostic-message substring mutations (covered by `evaluator_tests.rs §Diagnostic` but with weak assertions)
- Branch coverage on rare null-propagation paths
- Date/Decimal arithmetic edge cases

**Triage approach**: pull missed.txt grouped by function. The single-mutant kills are cheap; group them by `fn` and write one or two tests per group. Realistic target: 42 → ≤ 10 after a coverage pass, lifting kill rate ~88-90%.

### `error.rs` — 7 missed → triage (above floor, can defer)

```
src/error.rs:152:16: replace < with == in extension_arity_mismatch_message
src/error.rs:152:16: replace < with <= in extension_arity_mismatch_message
src/error.rs:155:16: replace > with >= in extension_arity_mismatch_message
src/error.rs:158:19: replace < with <= in extension_arity_mismatch_message
src/error.rs:280:20: delete ! in undefined_function_names_from_diagnostics
src/error.rs:295:43: replace == with != in has_error_diagnostics
src/error.rs:295:5: replace has_error_diagnostics -> bool with true
```

All **kill** candidates. The first four are boundary mutations in arity-mismatch message formatting — needs a test that runs the arity calculation at exact-arity boundaries. The latter three are `has_error_diagnostics` true/false discrimination — needs a test asserting that a mixed Error+Warning vec returns true, and an all-Warning vec returns false.

### `extensions/registry.rs` — 3 missed → triage

```
src/extensions/registry.rs:45:9: replace <impl Display for ExtensionError>::fmt with Ok(Default::default())
src/extensions/registry.rs:100:9: replace ExtensionRegistry::get -> Option<&ExtensionFunc> with None
src/extensions/registry.rs:105:9: replace ExtensionRegistry::contains -> bool with true
```

`get`/`contains` are **kill** — register a function, call it via the resolved path, assert the result. `Display::fmt` is **equivalent** unless the test suite asserts on formatted error strings (it does not today).

### `convert.rs` — 5 missed → triage (BELOW 80% FLOOR)

```
src/convert.rs:87:29: delete match arm Value::Number(n) in json_to_fel
src/convert.rs:94:29: delete match arm Value::String(s) in json_to_fel
src/convert.rs:38:5: replace field_map_from_json_str -> Result<HashMap<...>, String> with Ok(HashMap::new())
src/convert.rs:38:31: replace || with && in field_map_from_json_str
src/convert.rs:38:46: replace == with != in field_map_from_json_str
```

All **kill**. The Number/String match-arm deletions need tests that round-trip those specific JSON shapes through `json_to_fel` with strong-enough assertions to detect arm absence (current `fel_proptest` covers Money via the new value_to_expr fix from sha 1eee8b4 but Number/String paths need explicit assertions). `field_map_from_json_str` needs a happy-path test plus a non-object-input test.

### `parser.rs` — 28 missed + 1 timeout → triage (BELOW 85% FLOOR)

Worst absolute count outside prepare_host. The Cluster C parser_rejection_table covers a lot, but it doesn't exercise:
- Arithmetic-on-index mutations in `Parser::current`, `Parser::advance` (`-` ↔ `+`)
- Internal state-machine boundary checks (`< ` ↔ `<=`)
- `is_if_then_else` predicate logic (multiple guard mutations)

**kill** strategy: targeted tests against Parser internals — but Parser fields are private. Either expose more parse-shape assertions in `parser_rejection_tests.rs`/`evaluator_tests.rs`, or add a `#[cfg(test)] mod parser_internal_tests` block in `src/parser.rs` that can access internals. Inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block in `src/parser.rs` already has 69 unit tests; some survivors may live in code paths not exercised by those either.

### `prepare_host.rs` — 39 missed + 20 timeout → triage (LOWEST KILL RATE)

The Phase 3 prediction confirmed: `prepare_for_host` lacks a proptest. Survivors cluster around:
- Path-rewriting logic that the current `host_bindings.rs` tests exercise only at the happy-path level
- Branch coverage on optional-field navigation
- 20 timeouts → mutations that cause infinite recursion in path resolution

**Triage approach**: **defer to Phase 3**. The right fix is the missing proptest from Phase 3's plan; per-mutant kills would be band-aid. Open a single follow-up ticket against Phase 3 referencing this row.

### `dependencies.rs` — 10 missed → triage (LOWEST PERCENTAGE)

Same Phase 3 prediction: `extract_dependencies` lacks a proptest.

```
src/dependencies.rs:129:17: delete match arm "parent" in walk
src/dependencies.rs:132:17: delete match arm "instance" in walk
src/dependencies.rs:249:9: delete match arm Expr::VarRef{name, path} in extract_field_path_str
src/dependencies.rs:261:5: replace extend_field_path -> Option<String> with Some("xyzzy".into())
src/dependencies.rs:262:9: delete match arm Expr::FieldRef{..} | Expr::VarRef{..} in extend_field_path
src/dependencies.rs:261:5: replace extend_field_path -> Option<String> with Some(String::new())
src/dependencies.rs:261:5: replace extend_field_path -> Option<String> with None
src/dependencies.rs:282:5: replace dependencies_to_json_value -> serde_json::Value with Default::default()
src/dependencies.rs:269:9: delete match arm Expr::PostfixAccess{expr, path} in extend_field_path
src/dependencies.rs:290:5: replace dependencies_to_json_value_styled -> serde_json::Value with Default::default()
```

**kill** for the JSON-projection survivors (`dependencies_to_json_value*` — add assertions that the projection actually contains the extracted dependency keys, not just a default). **kill** the match-arm deletions via a proptest-shape test that constructs ASTs with each `Expr::*` variant and asserts the dep-extraction picks them up. Phase 3 ticket follows.

## Recommended fix order

1. **`error.rs` (7 kills)** — cheapest; pure boundary tests; lifts kill rate from 82% → ~95%.
2. **`extensions/registry.rs` (2 kills + 1 equivalent)** — small, raises to ~93%.
3. **`convert.rs` (5 kills)** — gets us above the ≥80% floor; lift to ~90%.
4. **`evaluator/builtins/dates.rs` (6 kills)** — already ✓ but easy lift.
5. **`evaluator/core.rs` (42 → ≤10 after coverage pass)** — biggest absolute win; gets above ≥85% floor.
6. **`parser.rs` (29 → ≤10)** — same; gets above ≥85% floor.
7. **`lexer.rs` (12+13)** — investigate timeouts first; may indicate real bug rather than test gap.
8. **`prepare_host.rs` + `dependencies.rs`** — defer to Phase 3 (proptests).

Phase 2 closure is achievable by completing items 1-7. Phase 3 covers 8.
